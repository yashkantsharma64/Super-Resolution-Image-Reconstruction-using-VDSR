# Super-Resolution Image Reconstruction using VDSR

This project implements a **Super-Resolution Image Reconstruction** system using the **VDSR (Very Deep Super-Resolution)** model. It aims to transform low-resolution images into high-resolution counterparts with enhanced details and quality. The system achieves a **PSNR value of 32.73 dB**, ensuring high-fidelity image restoration. Apart from this the **Patch Extraction** technique has also been used to enhance the results even further.

## Features
- **State-of-the-Art Model**: Implements a 20-layer deep VDSR network for efficient and accurate super-resolution.
- **High Performance**: Achieves a PSNR value of 32.73 dB, significantly enhancing image quality.
- **Optimized Training**: Trained on BSDS300 dataset having **300 high-resolution images** for robust performance.
- **Interactive UI**: Flask framework has been used to create a Flask app, providing an easy-to-use user-interface.

## Key Metrics
- **Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)**: 32.73 dB
